The process is called transpiration and it's essential for moving water to all parts of plants, even to the tops of the tallest trees. The experiment with a stick of celery reveals that this happens through special tubes, called xylems, which take up the food coloring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe process is accelerated by evaporation from the celery leaves and you can make it go even faster by using a hairdryer on the leaves. Compare the rate at which the color is taken up between three celery sticks: one with no leaves, one with leaves, and one with leaves applying a hairdryer. Using the hairdryer simulates a warm, windy summer's day when water in the ground from a recent downpour can soon find itself being transpired back into the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can imagine with the tallest trees that each water-carrying xylem contains a continuous, thin column of water over a hundred feet in length and reaching from the roots to the uppermost leaves. The effect of evaporation at the top of the tree literally pulls this column of water up the tree. The ability of these thin columns of water to be pulled in this way without breaking is attributed to the special forces between the water molecules in the liquid; this is called capillary action.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReprinted from \u003ca href=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/res/sots/activities/celery.htm\"\u003eScience on the Shelves.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","created_at":{"$date":"2012-02-06T04:55:10.000Z"},"duration":20,"grades":[5],"materials_note":"","materials_per_clas_ids":[],"materials_per_group_ids":[],"materials_per_student_ids":[],"note":"\u003cp\u003eForesman, p. 92; Macmillan, p.81, \u003ca href=\"http://www.sciencefairadventure.com/ProjectDetail.aspx?ProjectID=162\"\u003eColorful Celery\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/res/sots/activities/celery.htm\"\u003eScience on the Shelves,\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","objective":"\u003cp\u003eIdentify structures that support transport of materials in a plant.\u003c/p\u003e","procedure":"\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake a prediction.

Most fluids we know of are considered as Newtonian fluids, but non-Newtonian fluids are a strange and perplexing group of fluids. When a force (ex. poking, rolling, stirring) is applied to a non-Newtonian fluid, the viscosity (resistance to flow) of the fluid increases. In simple terms, any force you exert on a non-Newtonian fluid will make the fluid behave more like a solid. The more force you exert, the harder the fluid becomes. Strange but true!

As one of North America's oldest bird species, dating back at least 9 million years, sandhill cranes protect themselves effectively against predators such as coyotes, relying on keen eyesight as one of their primary defense mechanisms.","title":"Sandhill Cranes","url":"http://ca.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/klvx09.vid.klvxhumming/hummingbirds/"}],"materials_note":"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.raftbayarea.org/readpdf?isid=648\"\u003eBird Evolution Table\u003c/a\u003e, page 6, 2 copies per group.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.raftbayarea.org/readpdf?isid=648\"\u003eCritter Evolution Table\u003c/a\u003e, page 7, 2 copies per group.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClear tape is best.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e210 regular pony beads,\u0026nbsp;70 each of red, brown, black.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2 felt sheets or similar fabric, 1 black and 1\u0026nbsp;red, 30 x 46 cm (12” x 18”)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2oz portion cups are best, 1 per player, so a group of 6 would need 6 cups\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3 clothespins\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3 sets of chopsticks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4 forks\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4 spoons\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e","materials_per_clas_ids":[],"materials_per_group_ids":[{"$oid":"4f459166eeaf0a000100001f"},{"$oid":"4f600e20da72410001000011"},{"$oid":"4f87563adc4c21000100002f"},{"$oid":"4fa16ee50d3d050001000059"},{"$oid":"506130d783f6050002000051"},{"$oid":"506130ed83f6050002000054"},{"$oid":"5061312983f6050002000056"}],"materials_per_student_ids":[{"$oid":"4fa0cbcd0d3d05000100003f"}],"note":"","objective":"\u003cdiv\u003eSimulate evolution with some colorful “critters” and carnivorous “beaky\u0026nbsp;birds”.

However, when used in conjunction with other properties, color can be a good clue.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eStreak – Much more reliable than the outside color of a mineral, the streak is the color of the mineral when it is scratched or powdered. For example, the common mineral hematite occurs in a dull red, a rusty yellow, black, or shiny gray. However, no matter what the outside color is, when hematite is scratched, or streaked, it is always a dirty red. To obtain a streak color, rub the mineral across an unpolished porcelain tile, called a streak plate. One can also scratch a mineral with a nail or sharp knife blade and observe the color inside the mineral.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eLuster – Luster is the outward sheen or appearance of the mineral when held in natural light.

Cleavage is caused by planes of weakness within the crystal structure. Some minerals have only 1 plane of cleavage (mica breaks into flat sheets), while others have 3 planes of cleavage (halite breaks into cubes, calcite breaks into rhombohedrons) or even 4 planes of cleavage (fluorite). For some minerals, the angle formed by two or more directions of cleavage is characteristic. For example, pyroxene and amphibole are both dark brown, greenish, or blackish minerals that occur in many rocks. The easiest way to tell them apart is that pyroxene has a cleavage angle of 90 degrees, while amphibole has two cleavage angles of 60 and 120 degrees. Some minerals have poor cleavage (like pyrite) and some minerals have no cleavage and will fracture in random patterns (like quartz).\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eDensity (specific gravity) – Two minerals of the same size (volume) may feel to weigh differently. This property is called density and is technically called specific gravity. Specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a mineral to the weight of an equal volume of water. A mineral that is dense has a high specific gravity and will feel heavier in the hand than a mineral with a low specific gravity. The mineral galena, for example, has a high specific gravity and is very dense. It feels much heavier than a low specific gravity mineral such as mica or gypsum.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eSpecial Properties – Some minerals have special properties.

Caterpillars increase their body mass by as much as 1,000 times or more.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eThe larval stage of the life cycle is all about growth. Within the span of a few weeks, the caterpillar will grow exponentially. Because its cuticle, or skin, is only so pliable, the caterpillar will molt multiple times as it gains size and mass. The stage between molts is called an instar, and most caterpillars go through 5-6 instars before pupating.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e3. A caterpillar's first meal is usually its eggshell.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eIn most cases, when a caterpillar ecloses (hatches) from its egg, it will consume the remainder of the shell. The outer layer of the egg, called the chorion, is rich in protein, and provides the new larva with a nutritious start.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e4. A caterpillar has as many as 4,000 muscles in its body.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eThat's one seriously muscle-bound insect! By comparison, humans have just 629 muscles in a considerably larger body. The caterpillar's head capsule alone consists of 248 individual muscles, and about 70 muscles control each body segment. Remarkably, each of the 4,000 muscles is innervated by one or two neurons.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e5. Caterpillars have 12 eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/font\u003eOn each side of its head, a caterpillar has 6 tiny eyelets, called stemmata, arranged in a semi-circle. One of the 6 eyelets is usually offset a bit, and located closer to the antennae. You would think an insect with 12 eyes would have excellent eyesight, but that's not the case. The stemmata serve merely to help the caterpillar differentiate between light and dark. If you watch a caterpillar, you'll notice it sometimes moves its head from side to side. This most likely helps it judge depths and distances.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e6.\u0026nbsp;\u003cfont\u003eCaterpillars produce silk.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/font\u003eUsing modified salivary glands along the sides of their mouth, caterpillars can produce silk as needed. Some caterpillars, like gypsy moths, disperse by \"ballooning\" from the treetops on a silken thread. Others, such as eastern tent caterpillars or webworms, construct silk tents in which they live communally. Bagworms use silk to join dead foliage together into a shelter. Caterpillars also use silk when they pupate, either to suspend a chrysalis or to construct a cocoon.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e7.\u0026nbsp;\u003cfont\u003eCaterpillars have 6 legs, just as adult butterflies or moths do.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/font\u003eBut wait! There are way more than 6 legs on most caterpillars you've seen, right? Most of those legs are false legs, called prolegs, which help the caterpillar hold onto plant surfaces and allow it to climb. The 3 pairs of legs on the caterpillar's thoracic segments are the true legs, which it will retain in adulthood. A caterpillar may have up to 5 pairs of prolegs on its abdominal segments, usually including a terminal pair on the hind end.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e8.\u0026nbsp;\u003cfont\u003e\u0026nbsp;Caterpillars move in a wavelike motion, from back to front.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eCaterpillars with a full complement of prolegs move in a fairly predictable motion. Usually, the caterpillar will first anchor itself using the terminal pair of prolegs, and then reach forward with one pair of legs at a time, starting from the hind end. There's more going on than just leg action, though. The caterpillar's blood pressure changes as it moves forward, and its gut, which is basically a cylinder suspended inside its body, advances in sync with the head and rear end. Inchworms and loopers, which have fewer prolegs, move by pulling their hind ends forward in contact with the thorax, and then extending their front half.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e9. Caterpillars get creative when it comes to self defense.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eLife at the bottom of the food chain can be tough, so caterpillars employ all kinds of strategies to avoid becoming a bird snack. Some caterpillars, such as the early instars of black swallowtails, look like bird droppings. Certain inchworms in the family Geometridae mimic twigs, and bear markings that resemble leaf scars or bark. Other caterpillars use the opposite strategy, making themselves visible with bright colors to advertise their toxicity. A few caterpillars, like the spicebush swallowtail, display large eyespots to deter birds from eating them. If you've ever tried to take a caterpillar from its host plant, only to have it fall to the ground, you've observed it using thanatosis to thwart your efforts to collect it. A swallowtail caterpillar can be identified by its smelly osmeterium, a special defensive stink gland just behind the head.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003e10. Many caterpillars use the toxins from their host plants to their own advantage.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfont\u003eCaterpillars and plants co-evolve. Some host plants produce toxic or foul-tasting compounds meant to dissuade herbivores from munching their foliage. But many caterpillars can sequester the toxins in their bodies, effectively using these compounds to protect themselves from predators. The classic example of this is the monarch caterpillar and its host plant, milkweed. The monarch caterpillar ingests glycosides produced by the milkweed plant. These toxins remain within the monarch through adulthood, making the butterfly unpalatable to birds and other predators.\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/div\u003e","closure_duration":null,"created_at":{"$date":"2013-01-20T03:48:33.000Z"},"duration":null,"grades":[0],"links":[{"_id":{"$oid":"50fb6920df018b000200000c"},"url":"http://video.about.com/familycrafts/3-Easy-Egg-Carton-Crafts.htm","title":"Source","note":""}],"materials_note":"\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e8 egg cartons will serve 32 children if egg cartons are cut into 3-cup sections.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cfont\u003egoggly eyes can be purchased at teacher supply or craft stores.
