The process is called transpiration and it's essential for moving water to all parts of plants, even to the tops of the tallest trees. The experiment with a stick of celery reveals that this happens through special tubes, called xylems, which take up the food coloring.</p><p>The process is accelerated by evaporation from the celery leaves and you can make it go even faster by using a hairdryer on the leaves. Compare the rate at which the color is taken up between three celery sticks: one with no leaves, one with leaves, and one with leaves applying a hairdryer. Using the hairdryer simulates a warm, windy summer's day when water in the ground from a recent downpour can soon find itself being transpired back into the atmosphere.</p><p>You can imagine with the tallest trees that each water-carrying xylem contains a continuous, thin column of water over a hundred feet in length and reaching from the roots to the uppermost leaves. The effect of evaporation at the top of the tree literally pulls this column of water up the tree. The ability of these thin columns of water to be pulled in this way without breaking is attributed to the special forces between the water molecules in the liquid; this is called capillary action.</p><p>Reprinted from <a href=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/res/sots/activities/celery.htm\">Science on the Shelves.</a></p>", "created_at": { "$date": "2012-02-06T04:55:10.000Z" }, "duration": 20, "grades": [5], "materials_note": "", "materials_per_clas_ids": [], "materials_per_group_ids": [], "materials_per_student_ids": [], "note": "<p>Foresman, p. 92; Macmillan, p.81, <a href=\"http://www.sciencefairadventure.com/ProjectDetail.aspx?ProjectID=162\">Colorful Celery</a>, <a href=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/res/sots/activities/celery.htm\">Science on the Shelves,</a></p>", "objective": "<p>Identify structures that support transport of materials in a plant.</p>", "procedure": "<ol><li>Make a prediction.

All elements give off a limited number of wavelengths when they are heated and changed into gas. Each element always&nbsp;gives off the same group of wavelengths. This group is called the emission spectrum of the element.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>White light is a combination of different colors (ROYGBIV). The spectroscope that the students will build allows them to see the separation of incoming light (through the slit) into its component colors, forming a light spectrum (rainbow). Red light has a lower frequency (longer wavelength) than blue light. Diffraction gratings contain thousands of microscopic grooves, which cause light waves to bend (longer waves bend more). &nbsp;Different types of light sources emit different combinations of colors and these differences are revealed when the white light \"mix\" is sorted into a&nbsp;spectrum.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div></div><div>Besides creating interesting color patterns a&nbsp;spectroscope&nbsp;can be used to identify different sources of light. (See the links for additional activities using the spectroscope).</div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>In the visible wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, red, with the longest wavelength, is diffracted most; and violet, with the shortest wavelength, is diffracted least. Because each color is diffracted a different amount, each color bends at a different angle. The result is</font></div><div><font>a separation of white light into the seven major colors of the spectrum or rainbow.</font></div><div><font>A good way to remember these colors in order is the name Roy G. Biv. Each letter begins the name of a color: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><div><font>When atoms of different materials are excited by an electric current or other source of energy, they glow with a unique spectrum. Atoms of different elements have different colors in their spectra. These characteristic color patterns represent specific atoms, just as fingerprints serve to identify different people.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>A diffraction grating acts like a prism, spreading light into its component colors. The light that you see from a light source is the sum of all these colors. Each color corresponds to a different frequency of light. The diffraction grating sorts light by frequency, with violet light (the highest frequency of visible light) at one end of the spectrum and red light (the lowest frequency of visible light) at the other.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>When atoms in a dilute gas (like the mercury vapor in a mercury street light) radiate light, the light can be seen through a diffraction grating as a line spectrum, made up of bright lines of color.

As an atom emits light, it collides with other atoms. This changes the frequency of the light it emits.

Change a Light Bulb</b></div><div><div>Installing a compact fluorescent bulb (CFL) is the quickest, easiest way to save energy -- and money. Unlike incandescents, CFLs convert most of the energy they use into light rather than heat.</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: They consume about 75 percent less electricity and last up to 10 times longer (10,000 hours as opposed to 1,500). Replace one 75-watt incandescent bulb with a 25-watt CFL and save up to $83 over the life of the bulb.</div><div><br></div><div><div><font><b>2. Unplug Things That Glow</b></font></div><div><font>Anything that has an LED (light emitting diode) that glows even after you turn it off continues to draw power (that you pay for). Your TV, cell phone charger, and printer are likely culprits. Unplug the offenders from wall sockets and plug them into power strips instead. When you leave a room, flip the strip switch to cut the flow of electricity.</font></div><div><font><i>Good for You</i>: Unplug appliances and electronics that glow and you could save $200 a year.</font></div></div></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font><div><b>3. Recycle Your Electronics</b></div><div>Americans tossed out a whopping 5.5 billion pounds of electronics -- TVs, stereos, cell phones, and computers -- in 2005, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The result? Millions of pounds of chemicals and heavy metals ended up in the ground even though it's easier than ever to recycle electronics. The Consumer Electronics Association created mygreenelectronics.org to help people find a recycling resource in their area. The site also provides a list of electronics, from laptops to baby monitors, that are easier on the environment and your energy bill.</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: The average American household has three cell phones stashed in a drawer. Sell unused cell phones to greenphone.com. You'll receive about $35, and the phones will be refurbished and resold. If 1 million people recycled one cathode-ray tube TV this year, we'd keep 4 million pounds of lead out of the ground.</div><div><br></div><div><div><b>4. Audit Your Energy</b></div><div>It's easier to save energy when you know exactly how much and where you're using it. Investing in a home audit takes a couple of hours and pays off with a list of things you can do to curb consumption. Find an auditor through your utility company (at low or no cost), or hire one ($450-$650). A list of auditors certified by the nonprofit Residential Energy Services Network, is at resnet.us (click on Consumer Information).</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: On average, an energy audit shows how to save up to 30 percent on utility bills.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>5. Support Local Farmers</b></div><div>If your food could talk, it would tell quite a tale. Typical grocery store produce travels nearly 1,500 miles before it ends up on your plate. All this traveling burns fossil fuels and results in carbon emissions -- a fancy term for pollution. Buying from local farmers means you're not only getting the freshest food possible, you're saving energy.</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: To find farmers nationwide, visit localharvest.org, sustainabletable.org, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture at www.ams.usda.govfarmersmarkets/map.htm.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>6. Fix That Drip</b></div><div>When you next fill your water glass, think about this: We each use about 100 gallons a day, enough to fill 1,600 glasses. Household water consumption has increased by 200 percent since 1950, even though the population has grown by only 90 percent. As a result, more than 36 states are expected to face water shortages in the next six years. Stemming the flow is as easy as fixing a leaky faucet or toilet; a dripping faucet can waste up to 74 gallons a day, a leaking toilet up to 200 gallons a day.</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: Repair a leaky toilet and you can save $30 a year, which may not sound like much until you realize it means 73,000 gallons.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>7. Let Your Grass Grow</b></div><div>Spending less time tending to your lawn actually makes it greener -- in every sense of the word. Most grass species fare best when they're kept at least 2 1/2 inches tall. The length creates more surface area to absorb sunlight, which creates thicker turf and deeper roots, which means you won't need to water as often.</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: Save money by letting grass clippings remain on your lawn; it adds nitrogen to the soil and discourages weed seeds from germinating. You'll need less fertilizer and herbicide. Plus, leaving clippings on lawns means less in landfills; in 2005 Americans disposed of more than 12 million tons of yard waste.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>8. Look for the Label</b></div><div>When it's time to replace a household appliance, choose a product with an Energy Star label. Sponsored by the EPA and the Department of Energy, the Energy Star program rates products from light bulbs to kitchen appliances. Energy Star labels guarantee that products are energy-efficient. For example, a battery charger labeled with the Energy Star logo will use 35 percent less energy than a standard one. You may even be eligible for a tax credit when you purchase an Energy Star product. Information at energystar.gov.</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: A household with Energy Star products uses about 30 percent less energy than the average household -- an annual savings of about $570.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>9. Do Full Loads</b></div><div>Whenever you wash just a few clothes or dishes at a time rather than waiting for a full load to accumulate, you're wasting water, power, and money. The average American family of four washes about 540 loads of laundry a year, which consumes up to 21,000 gallons of water, and more than 150 loads of dishes, which uses about 1,500 gallons. Most of the energy consumed by washers goes toward heating the water -- about 90 percent in the clothes washer and 80 percent in the dishwasher. Combining half-loads, choosing short cycles, and using cold or warm rather than hot water in the clothes washer racks up savings.</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: Wash two fewer loads of clothes and one fewer load of dishes a week and save up to 4,500 gallons of water a year.</div></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>10. Work the Critters</b></div><div>Your backyard ecosystem is as intricate as any wild patch of land, and it pays in many ways to enlist its creatures on your side. Birds eat many insects; they just need a water source and trees and shrubs for cover and nesting. Many insects are beautiful -- and beneficial. Ladybugs aren't just cute; they are voracious eaters of aphids.</div><div><i>Good for You</i>: To understand which backyard insects are garden friends, visit garden.org and click on Pest Control Library for photos.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></font></div>", "objective": "<div><br></div>The students will:<div><ul><li>define reduce, reuse, and recycle.</li><li>recommend ways to reduce, reuse and recycle at school.</li><li>calculate the amount of water wasted at school.</li><li>provide a rationale for implementing water conservation practices at school.</li></ul></div>", "procedure": "<div><b>Part A - Making a Change at School - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</b></div><ol><li>Show the&nbsp;<i>YouTube Go Green Video</i>&nbsp;video.</li><li>Share the information from the&nbsp;video&nbsp;or web site highlighting the definitions of reduce, reuse, and recycle.</li><li>Show the relia&nbsp;of items which can be reduced (a cloth shopping bag to reduce the use of plastic bags), reused (an empty milk carton to use for a watering can), recycled (a newspaper to be sent to a recycling center and made into new paper).</li><li>Pass out handout,&nbsp;<i>What Is Reduce, Reuse &amp; Recycle? </i>for students to read aloud.</li><li>Pass out the <i>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle </i>Worksheet for School.&nbsp;</li><li>Have the students complete the worksheet by writing a brief definition of each word.&nbsp;</li><li>Brainstorm ways the students can reduce, reuse, and recycle at school.

Most fluids we know of are considered as Newtonian fluids, but non-Newtonian fluids are a strange and perplexing group of fluids. When a force (ex. poking, rolling, stirring) is applied to a non-Newtonian fluid, the viscosity (resistance to flow) of the fluid increases. In simple terms, any force you exert on a non-Newtonian fluid will make the fluid behave more like a solid. The more force you exert, the harder the fluid becomes. Strange but true!

The densities of solids remain constant while that of liquids and gases change with a change in temperature.</li><li>It is found that egg is of the same density as that of normal water. This means that both of them weigh the same per unit volume. When salt is added to water, some more mass is added into it without any change in the volume. The weight of unit volume of normal water will be less than that of salt water based on the quantity of salt that was added. So.. if you were to fill two containers with equal amounts (volume) of water, one of salt water, the other tap water, the salt water would weigh more.

Here is a&nbsp;thorough&nbsp;description of the five sense of flowers that might help you during this garden sense activity.</font><div><div><font><b>What Are the Five Senses of Flowers?</b></font></div><div><i><font>By Joan Norton, eHow Contributo</font><font>r</font></i></div><div><font>Flowers are good for our psychological and physical health. A flower garden offers us experience of all five senses; touch, taste, smell, hearing and seeing. Sense perception is how we know our world and how we produce biological feelings of enjoyment. Feelings of enjoyment enhance health. A walk through a garden of flowers expands and enriches nerve cells in the brain that help create feelings of contentment and cooperation.</font></div><div><b>Touch</b></div><div><font>Touching a flower activates the body's sense receptors that provide information to the brain. Touch determines safety or danger and stimulates a hormone response appropriate to either situation. Flowers are often soft to the touch, which enhances the feeling of safety and pleasure. Gentle touch releases the hormone oxytoxin, which is responsible for feelings of trust and cooperation.</font></div><div><font><b>Taste</b></font></div><div><font>Marigolds, nasturtiums and roses are flowers that are often used in salads. Nasturtiums have a sharpness that stimulates the taste buds on the back of the tongue. The taste buds that detect the sweetness of rose petals are located on the front of the tongue. Anise plants produce a strong licorice taste that the sense of taste perceives as soothing and sweet.</font></div><div><font><b>Smell</b></font></div><div><font>According to University of California Riverside psychologist Lawrence D. Rosenblum, smelling activates nerve cells that induce brain activity related to memory, attention and emotion.There is no quicker way to enhance feelings of contentment than by smelling flowers that you love. Memories of earlier pleasures are stimulated, releasing hormones that produce contentment.</font></div><div><font><b>Sound</b></font></div><div><font>Flowers are often accompanied by the sound of birds singing and bees buzzing. Nerve cells in the inner ear send signals to the brain that let us know whether a sound is disturbing or pleasurable. The brain reacts by creating good feelings when the sound is a familiar good one, like birds singing near flowers. Pleasant sounds relax the nervous system and help us maintain physical and emotional balance.</font></div><div><font><b>Sight</b></font></div><div><font>The sight of beautiful flowers stimulates emotional reactions of contentment. Eyes perceive texture, form, movement, light and shadow in a garden, each experience sending information to the brain. Pleasure centers are activated by beautiful flowers and feelings of enjoyment are the result. The experience of pleasure from flowers is enhanced when accompanied by other sensory inputs such as the sound of a bubbling fountain.</font></div></div>", "closure_duration": 10, "created_at": { "$date": "2012-10-25T01:39:54.000Z" }, "duration": 30, "grades": [0, 1], "links": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "5088994599b7220002000022" }, "note": "", "title": "Book: The Growing Classroom", "url": "http://www.amazon.com/The-Growing-Classroom-Garden-Based-Science/dp/0915873486" }], "materials_note": "If the garden is dormant or not very big, you may \"plant\" opposite items in the beds, such as pebbles, leaves, moss, or other easily identifiable items.", "materials_per_clas_ids": [{ "$oid": "4f8b2038f40044000100003c" }, { "$oid": "508898e799b722000200001e" }], "materials_per_group_ids": [{ "$oid": "508898c999b722000200001b" }], "materials_per_student_ids": [], "note": "", "objective": "To identify and classify objects in the garden using the senses.<div><br></div>", "procedure": "<ol><li><font>Divide the class into groups of three or more if there is an adult with each group.</font></li><li><font>Tell the class that they will be using a special container in which to collect 12 items.

Some of these properties are:<br><div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Color – The color of the mineral as described in natural light. Color is not a reliable identifying property. Chemical impurities, crystal flaws, and oxide coatings on the outside of minerals can cause any one mineral to occur in many different colors. For example, quartz is usually clear or white, but also occurs in purple, yellow, and red. However, when used in conjunction with other properties, color can be a good clue.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Streak – Much more reliable than the outside color of a mineral, the streak is the color of the mineral when it is scratched or powdered. For example, the common mineral hematite occurs in a dull red, a rusty yellow, black, or shiny gray. However, no matter what the outside color is, when hematite is scratched, or streaked, it is always a dirty red. To obtain a streak color, rub the mineral across an unpolished porcelain tile, called a streak plate. One can also scratch a mineral with a nail or sharp knife blade and observe the color inside the mineral.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Luster – Luster is the outward sheen or appearance of the mineral when held in natural light. Luster is divided into two major categories: metallic and non-metallic. The non-metallic category is then further described using such common terms as silky, pearly, glassy (vitreous), or dull.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Hardness – Hardness is a measure of a mineral’s resistance to scratching. Hardness is measured on Moh’s hardness scale, with a 1 being the softest (talc) and 10 being the hardest (diamond). The numbers on the scale are relative, not absolute. That is, diamond is not really 10 times harder than talc; it is actually about 200 times harder. Moh’s hardness scale is:</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>1 – talc</font></div><div><font>2 – gypsum</font></div><div><font>3 – calcite</font></div><div><font>4 – fluorite</font></div><div><font>5 – apatite</font></div><div><font>6 – orthoclase</font></div><div><font>7 – quartz</font></div><div><font>8 – topaz</font></div><div><font>9 – corundum</font></div><div><font>10 – diamond</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Hardness is determined by scratching the mineral with several tools to determine which is harder, the tool or the mineral.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>2 – fingernail</font></div><div><font>2.5 – copper penny</font></div><div><font>5 – steel nail</font></div><div><font>5.5 – glass plate</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>For example, if a mineral scratches a copper penny but is itself scratched by a steel nail, the mineral has a hardness between 2.5 and 5.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Crystal Habit – If given the opportunity to grow in an open space, all minerals will grow in a distinctive crystal shape, called habit. Some minerals have several shapes. Quartz tends to grow in six-sided columns capped by a six-sided pyramid. Pyrite tends to grow in cubes.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Cleavage – Cleavage defines how a mineral breaks. Cleavage is caused by planes of weakness within the crystal structure. Some minerals have only 1 plane of cleavage (mica breaks into flat sheets), while others have 3 planes of cleavage (halite breaks into cubes, calcite breaks into rhombohedrons) or even 4 planes of cleavage (fluorite). For some minerals, the angle formed by two or more directions of cleavage is characteristic. For example, pyroxene and amphibole are both dark brown, greenish, or blackish minerals that occur in many rocks. The easiest way to tell them apart is that pyroxene has a cleavage angle of 90 degrees, while amphibole has two cleavage angles of 60 and 120 degrees. Some minerals have poor cleavage (like pyrite) and some minerals have no cleavage and will fracture in random patterns (like quartz).</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Density (specific gravity) – Two minerals of the same size (volume) may feel to weigh differently. This property is called density and is technically called specific gravity. Specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a mineral to the weight of an equal volume of water. A mineral that is dense has a high specific gravity and will feel heavier in the hand than a mineral with a low specific gravity. The mineral galena, for example, has a high specific gravity and is very dense. It feels much heavier than a low specific gravity mineral such as mica or gypsum.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Special Properties – Some minerals have special properties. Magnetite is magnetic and is attracted to a magnet. A special type of magnetite, called lodestone, is a magnet and can pick up paper clips. Calcite will react to hydrochloric acid and will fizz. Some minerals fluoresce in ultraviolet light. Halite tastes salty.</font></div></div>", "closure_duration": null, "created_at": { "$date": "2012-11-29T05:44:58.000Z" }, "duration": null, "grades": [2], "links": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "50b6f6962b89ee0002000009" }, "url": "http://www.teachersdomain.org/resource/idptv11.sci.ess.earthsys.d4krom/", "title": "Video: Rocks and Minerals", "note": "3min.&nbsp;This video segment from IdahoPTV's D4K defines the different types of rock and how they are formed.

Having trouble getting your child to follow your words? Well, who doesn’t! &nbsp;This blind obstacle course turns the art of listening into an outdoor game. Give it a try, and see who’s better at following directions, you or her?</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>What You Need:</font></div><div><font>One scarf-- to use as a blindfold</font></div><div><font>Medium sized objects, to be used as obstacles</font></div><div><font>Ball</font></div><div><font>Bucket or a basket for the ball to go into</font></div><div><font>What You Do:</font></div><div><font>Set it Up. The first step in this activity of extraordinary trust is to set up the obstacle course. A large grassy area is the ideal setting for the event. Use a variety of medium sized objects to set up the obstacle course. For example:</font></div><div><font>Cones- to go around</font></div><div><font>Pillows- to step on top of, or over</font></div><div><font>Small boxes- to step into, or pick up</font></div><div><font>Hoola Hoops- to jump inside of, or pick up and drop over the body!</font></div><div><font>Jump ropes- to duck underneath, put inside of a nearby box, or wrap around something</font></div><div><font>The idea is to create a course that your child can maneuver around safely by following your directions. Place the objects about four feet apart, ending at a box or basket, which will be used as the ‘goal’.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>Talk About Left and Right. If your child has difficulty remembering which is which, show her that if she holds her hands up with her thumbs down, the left hand will make an ‘L’ for left.</font></div><div><font>Introduce the Course. Walk your child over to the starting line and explain that you're going to give her directions to the finish line, where she'll place the ball in the basket to make a goal. Emphasize the need to listen very carefully and do only what you say (sounds like a dream come true!). Then cover both her eyes with the blindfold.</font></div><div><font>Direct! Keep your directions short and simple, giving one command at a time. For example, “Take three hops forward” or “Take one big step to the left”. As she becomes comfortable with the game you can give her a two-step direction to follow, such as “Take one large step backwards and two steps to the right.” Guide your child around the obstacle course to the finish line, where she can place the ball into the basket. Goal!</font></div><div><font>Once you've successfully directed your child to the finish line, it’s your turn to put on the blindfold and be directed. Learning to follow directions is a key kindergarten skill, but getting to direct mom or dad is a rare and fun turning of the tables! This activity is perfect for a sunny day, and it’s a great activity to play in teams, so have the whole family join in!</font></div></div>", "duration": null, "closure_duration": null, "assessment": "", "note": "", "user_id": { "$oid": "4f2db509af0c2e000100000b" }, "updated_at": { "$date": "2013-01-20T03:42:23.000Z" }, "created_at": { "$date": "2013-01-20T03:42:24.000Z" }, "T": "act" }, "50fb6911df018b0002000008": { "_id": { "$oid": "50fb6911df018b0002000008" }, "assessment": "", "assistant_setup": "Pre-cut egg cartons into 3-cup sections. 8 egg cartons will serve 32 children.", "background": "<div><font>Bugs and insects are not the&nbsp;synonymous.</font></div><div>\"True bugs\" have a mouth that is shaped like a straw or needle, which is called a stylet or rostrum. They also have a very specific membranous wing, which is thick and darkly colored where it connects to the body,&nbsp;but becomes thin and almost transparent toward its end. Insects that do not have a rostrum mouth or membranous wings, such as ants, termites, butterflies, mosquitoes, fleas and lice (just to name a few) would not be considered \"true bugs\" as they do not have one or both of these features.</div><div><br></div><div>Facts about caterpillars:</div><div><font>1.&nbsp;A caterpillar has just one job – to eat.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font>During the larval stage, the caterpillar must consume enough to sustain itself into adulthood. Without proper nutrition, it may not have the energy to complete its metamorphosis, or may be unable to develop eggs as an adult. Caterpillars can eat an enormous amount during a life cycle stage that typically lasts several weeks. Some consume 27,000 times their body weight during this life phase.</font></div><div><font>2. Caterpillars increase their body mass by as much as 1,000 times or more.</font></div><div><font>The larval stage of the life cycle is all about growth. Within the span of a few weeks, the caterpillar will grow exponentially. Because its cuticle, or skin, is only so pliable, the caterpillar will molt multiple times as it gains size and mass. The stage between molts is called an instar, and most caterpillars go through 5-6 instars before pupating.</font></div><div><font>3. A caterpillar's first meal is usually its eggshell.</font></div><div><font>In most cases, when a caterpillar ecloses (hatches) from its egg, it will consume the remainder of the shell. The outer layer of the egg, called the chorion, is rich in protein, and provides the new larva with a nutritious start.</font></div><div><font>4. A caterpillar has as many as 4,000 muscles in its body.</font></div><div><font>That's one seriously muscle-bound insect! By comparison, humans have just 629 muscles in a considerably larger body. The caterpillar's head capsule alone consists of 248 individual muscles, and about 70 muscles control each body segment. Remarkably, each of the 4,000 muscles is innervated by one or two neurons.</font></div><div><font>5. Caterpillars have 12 eyes.&nbsp;</font>On each side of its head, a caterpillar has 6 tiny eyelets, called stemmata, arranged in a semi-circle. One of the 6 eyelets is usually offset a bit, and located closer to the antennae. You would think an insect with 12 eyes would have excellent eyesight, but that's not the case. The stemmata serve merely to help the caterpillar differentiate between light and dark. If you watch a caterpillar, you'll notice it sometimes moves its head from side to side. This most likely helps it judge depths and distances.</div><div>6.&nbsp;<font>Caterpillars produce silk.&nbsp;</font>Using modified salivary glands along the sides of their mouth, caterpillars can produce silk as needed. Some caterpillars, like gypsy moths, disperse by \"ballooning\" from the treetops on a silken thread. Others, such as eastern tent caterpillars or webworms, construct silk tents in which they live communally. Bagworms use silk to join dead foliage together into a shelter. Caterpillars also use silk when they pupate, either to suspend a chrysalis or to construct a cocoon.</div><div>7.&nbsp;<font>Caterpillars have 6 legs, just as adult butterflies or moths do.&nbsp;</font>But wait! There are way more than 6 legs on most caterpillars you've seen, right? Most of those legs are false legs, called prolegs, which help the caterpillar hold onto plant surfaces and allow it to climb. The 3 pairs of legs on the caterpillar's thoracic segments are the true legs, which it will retain in adulthood. A caterpillar may have up to 5 pairs of prolegs on its abdominal segments, usually including a terminal pair on the hind end.</div><div>8.&nbsp;<font>&nbsp;Caterpillars move in a wavelike motion, from back to front.</font></div><div><font>Caterpillars with a full complement of prolegs move in a fairly predictable motion. Usually, the caterpillar will first anchor itself using the terminal pair of prolegs, and then reach forward with one pair of legs at a time, starting from the hind end. There's more going on than just leg action, though. The caterpillar's blood pressure changes as it moves forward, and its gut, which is basically a cylinder suspended inside its body, advances in sync with the head and rear end. Inchworms and loopers, which have fewer prolegs, move by pulling their hind ends forward in contact with the thorax, and then extending their front half.</font></div><div><font>9. Caterpillars get creative when it comes to self defense.</font></div><div><font>Life at the bottom of the food chain can be tough, so caterpillars employ all kinds of strategies to avoid becoming a bird snack. Some caterpillars, such as the early instars of black swallowtails, look like bird droppings. Certain inchworms in the family Geometridae mimic twigs, and bear markings that resemble leaf scars or bark. Other caterpillars use the opposite strategy, making themselves visible with bright colors to advertise their toxicity. A few caterpillars, like the spicebush swallowtail, display large eyespots to deter birds from eating them. If you've ever tried to take a caterpillar from its host plant, only to have it fall to the ground, you've observed it using thanatosis to thwart your efforts to collect it. A swallowtail caterpillar can be identified by its smelly osmeterium, a special defensive stink gland just behind the head.</font></div><div><font>10. Many caterpillars use the toxins from their host plants to their own advantage.</font></div><div><font>Caterpillars and plants co-evolve. Some host plants produce toxic or foul-tasting compounds meant to dissuade herbivores from munching their foliage. But many caterpillars can sequester the toxins in their bodies, effectively using these compounds to protect themselves from predators. The classic example of this is the monarch caterpillar and its host plant, milkweed. The monarch caterpillar ingests glycosides produced by the milkweed plant. These toxins remain within the monarch through adulthood, making the butterfly unpalatable to birds and other predators.</font></div>", "closure_duration": null, "created_at": { "$date": "2013-01-20T03:48:33.000Z" }, "duration": null, "grades": [0], "links": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "50fb6920df018b000200000c" }, "url": "http://video.about.com/familycrafts/3-Easy-Egg-Carton-Crafts.htm", "title": "Source", "note": "" }], "materials_note": "<ul><li>8 egg cartons will serve 32 children if egg cartons are cut into 3-cup sections.</li><li><font>goggly eyes can be purchased at teacher supply or craft stores.

Obviously, the individual colors on the wheel are not mixing. The color mixing that happens is due to the speed at which the wheel is spinning as the string twists it. &nbsp;The colors are spinning at such a rate that your brain is unable to process them as the individual colors that are on the wheel. &nbsp;Instead, your brain takes a shortcut and creates the secondary colors.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font><b>Now, why does the string continue to twist?</b>&nbsp;</font></div><div><font>The answer lies in physics and, in particular, momentum. &nbsp;Once you have the string twisted, pulling on each end causes it to go tight. &nbsp;When the string is pulled tight, it wants to be completely straight. In going straight, the string unwinds from itself and causes the disc to spin one direction. &nbsp;But the string doesn't stop once it's unwound. It speeds past and gets twisted again. &nbsp;The momentum from pulling the string tight keeps the disc spinning until all the momentum is gone. Then you pull the strings tight again and set the disc spinning in another direction.</font></div></div><div><br></div><div>Color is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum and has always existed, although Sir Isaac Newton provided the first explanation of color in 1666. Newton passed a narrow beam of sunlight through a prism located in a dark room. Of course the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) was displayed on the white screen.</div><font><div><font><br></font></div><div><font>People already knew that light passed through a prism would show a rainbow or visible spectrum, but Newton’s experiments showed that different colors are bent through different angles. Newton also thought all colors can be found in white light, so he passed the light through a second prism. All the visible colors changed back to white light. Light is the only source of color.</font></div><div><font><br></font></div><font>All elements or pure substances, such as gold, silver, neon, or hydrogen, give off a set of wavelengths of light when they are heated. Scientists can study the light given off by stars and other objects in space or heated substances here on Earth and identify the kinds of elements that are present. In fact, the element helium, which is a very light gas, was discovered by studying the spectral lines of the Sun. Later, helium was found here on Earth. Scientists who study light use very complicated spectroscopes to observe and measure wavelengths given off by light sources.</font></font><div><font><br></font></div><div>The color of an object is seen because the object merely reflects, absorbs, and transmits one or more colors that make up light. The endless variety of color is caused by the interrelationship of three elements: Light, the source of color; the material and its response to color; and the eye, the perceiver of color. Colors made by combining blue, yellow, and red light are called additive; and they are formed by adding varying degrees of intensity and amounts of these three colors.</div><div><div>These primary colors of light are called cyan (blue-green), yellow, and magenta (blue-red).</div></div><div><font><br></font></div><div><font><div>Pigment color found in paint, dyes, or pigment molecules present in flowers, trees, and animals form ink. Absorbing, or subtracting makes the color, certain parts of the spectrum and reflecting or transmitting the parts that remain.

But when you're in the sun, your shadow is often nearby. It may be in front of you or behind you. Or it may be to your side. Wherever it is, your shadow looks like you and moves like you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Two things are needed to make a shadow. The first is light. The second is something that blocks the light. Together, these two things make an area that is darker than what is around it. This area is called a shadow.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Outside, people make shadows when they block light from the sun. Think about what happens when the sun is behind you. Your body blocks some of the sun's light, causing a shadow to form in front of you. The shadow takes on the shape of your body.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When the sun is in front of you, the shadow forms behind you. If the sun is to your left, then the shadow forms to your right. If the sun is to your right, then the shadow forms to your left.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Trees and building also make shadows. Their shadows can keep you cool on a hot sunny day. Shadows stay cool because they are blocked from the sun's light. The sun's light is what heats the ground, which then heats the air above.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Other things make shadows, too. Clouds make shadows when they pass in front of the sun. A baseball cap makes a shadow on your face, keeping it cool.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Shadows come in many sizes. A small person makes a small shadow. A big building makes a big shadow. The position of the sun affects the size of a shadow. A person or object blocks more light when the sun is low in the sky. More blocked light makes shadows longer. Less light is blocked when the sun is high in the sky. This makes shadows shorter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Can you think of a really big shadow? Here's a hint: You see it every night.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The shadow from an umbrella on the beach can keep you cool. Image Credit: Liquid Library</div><div>The night sky is simply a very large shadow. The sky turns dark when your part of Earth spins away from the sun. Earth blocks the sun's light from reaching the sky above you. No light means no heat. That's why nights are almost always cooler than days.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Shadows exist in space, too. MESSENGER is a NASA spacecraft on its way to study Mercury. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. The scientists who built MESSENGER wanted to make sure it wouldn't get too hot. So they covered the side that faces the sun with a large piece of fabric. The fabric is called a \"sunshade.\" It feels like a hard cloth. It makes a shadow by blocking the sun's light. This shadow keeps the spacecraft cool.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Back on Earth, you can do a lot of fun things with shadows. Outside, you can trace a shadow with chalk. Then you can watch how it changes as the sun moves across the sky. Inside, you can make shadows using a flashlight or lamp and a piece of poster board.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You can even chase your own shadow. Do you think you'd ever catch it?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Never look directly at the sun when learning about or playing with shadows. Looking at the sun can hurt your eyes.&nbsp;</div></font><font><br></font></div>", "closure_duration": 10, "created_at": { "$date": "2013-03-17T03:03:20.000Z" }, "duration": 30, "grades": [0], "links": [{ "_id": { "$oid": "5145328bd960ad000200000e" }, "url": "http://www.brighthubeducation.com/preschool-lesson-plans/38717-shadow-activities-and-lesson-for-preschool/", "title": "Source", "note": "" }, { "_id": { "$oid": "5145329fd960ad0002000012" }, "url": "http://www.readwritethink.org/classroom-resources/lesson-plans/casting-shadows-across-literacy-1016.html?tab=4#session1", "title": "Source", "note": "" }, { "_id": { "$oid": "51454132d960ad0002000033" }, "url": "http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/F_Keeping_Cool_With_Shadows.html", "title": "Source", "note": "" }], "materials_note": "<ul><li><font>Butcher paper should be white, but other colors work.
